CONTROLLER SUPPORT!

Pressing F1 will open a menu that allows you to alter Gamepad controls.

Here is a note to keep in mind:

The letters the engine uses for its button layout does NOT refer to the letters on your keyboard.

For instance:

R = W on the keyboard
X = A on the keyboard
Y = S on the keyboard
Z = D on the keyboard
